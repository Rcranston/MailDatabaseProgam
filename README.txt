CSCD 371 Final Project

This software should be ready right out of the box..
Somethings to be considered for extra credit would be 

*entering any email into the "To:" user box to send to mail outside of the database.
*you can search any by any section of the last name not just the first letter. 
*the other feature is a clear database function 
 so you can clean it up if your wanting to share the program without sharing the interworkings of your computer.

Bugs
*does not run on accounts that use 2 factor authentication
*google accounts have to have less secure applications enabled in their account settings.
